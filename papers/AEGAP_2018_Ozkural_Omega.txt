Omega: An Architecture for AI Unification
Eray Ã–zkural

We introduce the open-ended, modular, selfimproving Omega AI unification architecture which is a refinement of Solomonoff's Alpha architecture, as considered from first principles. The architecture embodies several crucial principles of general intelligence including diversity of representations, diversity of data types, integrated memory, modularity, and higherorder cognition. We retain the basic design of a fundamental algorithmic substrate called an \AI kernel" for problem solving and basic cognitive functions like memory, and a larger, modular architecture that re-uses the kernel in many ways. Omega includes eight representation languages, which are brie y introduced. We review the broad software architecture, higher-order cognition, self-improvement, modular neural architectures, intelligent agents, the process and memory hierarchy, hardware abstraction, peer-to-peer computing, and data abstraction facility.
