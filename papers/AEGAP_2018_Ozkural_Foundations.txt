The Foundations of Deep Learning with a Path Towards General Intelligence
Eray Ã–zkural

Like any formal field of science, AI may be ap- proached axiomatically. We formulate require- ments for a general-purpose, human-level AI system in terms of postulates. We review the methodology of deep learning, examining the explicit and tacit assumptions in deep learn- ing research. Deep Learning methodology seeks to overcome limitations in traditional machine learning research as it combines facets of model richness, generality, and practical applicabil- ity. The methodology so far has produced out- standing results due to a productive synergy of function approximation, under plausible as- sumptions of irreducibility and the efficiency of back-propagation family of algorithms. We examine these winning traits of deep learn- ing, and also observe the various known failure modes of deep learning. We conclude by giv- ing recommendations on how to extend deep learning methodology to cover the postulates of general-purpose AI including modularity, and cognitive architecture. We also relate deep learning to advances in theoretical neuroscience research.
