Abduction, Deduction & Causal-Relational Models
Kristinn R. Th√≥risson and Arthur Talbot

We consider the role of abduction and deduction in a controller that explicitly and continuously models its environment, and uses these models as a basis for its predictions and actions. Several important features of such cumulative modeling are identified, including how to prune and continuously refine the model set towards representing true causal relations between observed variables.
