Data Mining by Non-Axiomatic Reasoning
Patrick Hammer

Data Mining takes many forms and is usually carried out by algorithms that were specially designed for the task at hand. In this paper we present the usage of a Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS) for Data Mining purposes. NARS is a general-purpose reasoner that enables reasoning about data while not being restricted to specific Data Mining problems, allowing for a broad range of applications. This paper evalu- ates the approach on specific data sets, and contains improvements and comparisons with other techniques. Additionally, the included LazyMiner use case demonstrates autonomous NARS-based rule mining under hard resource constraints on mobile devices.
