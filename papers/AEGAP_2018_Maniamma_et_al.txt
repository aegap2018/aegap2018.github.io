Human Abduction for Solving Puzzles to Find Logically Explicable Rules to Discriminate Two Picture Groups Ostracized Each Other: An Ontology-based Model

Human brains not only have a learning ability based on the probabilistic model known as machine learning scheme, but also the logical reasoning and an intuition to understand what the whole picture represents as cognitive competency. Former ability can be reproduced artificially such as deep learning system, while the latter cognitive function is expected to provide in Semantic Web approaches recently. Bongard Problem (BP) was proposed as a benchmark test for human-level intelligence to solve ill-posed problems. BP is a set of puzzles and the solution is not determined by visual characteristics locally but it is only determined by relational information with a logical consistency in total. In the present paper, we proposed a hierarchical model for solving BPs to mimic how human locally think by using semantic (meta-descriptive) knowledge accompanied with logical reasoning steps. In the assumption that the long-term memory kept in an ontological way with logical rules, the reasoning system was designed to generate automatically a minimum set of properties in representation to satisfy the existence of the total logical consistency from given data set as a short-term memory after conversion to the RDF form in OWL using the Java-based interface to treat dynamic ontological instances. Our computer experiments demonstrated that the proposed framework works well as the BP solver in the logical inference process narrowing down possibilities to obtain a unique solution.
